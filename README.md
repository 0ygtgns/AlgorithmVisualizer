# Algorithm Visualizer

![Application Screenshot](https://placehold.co/800x400/2c2f33/f5f5f5?text=Algorithm+Visualizer+UI)

This project is an interactive web application that visualizes the operational steps of various sorting and searching algorithms in real-time. It was developed entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to help users see the complex logic of algorithms in a concrete and understandable way.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Wide Algorithm Support:** Includes many popular and educational sorting and searching algorithms.
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - **Generate Array:** Create new arrays of random numbers.
  - **Adjust Size and Speed:** Instantly change the size of the array and the speed of the animation.
  - **Stop Function:** Stop a running algorithm at any time.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch every step of the algorithm (comparison, swap, etc.) live with color-coded bars and status updates.
- **Numeric Value Display:** Makes tracking easier by displaying the numerical value on each bar.
- **Dynamic Status Panel:** A panel that clearly indicates which algorithm is running and what operation it is currently performing (e.g., "Comparing 52 & 17").

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was developed without any libraries or frameworks to demonstrate the power of core web technologies:

- **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS3:** For visualization, animations, and general styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all algorithm logic, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential ideas to further develop the project:

- **More Algorithms:** Add pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's or A*.
- **Data Structures:** Visualize data structures like Binary Search Trees, Graphs, or Linked Lists.
- **Code Display:** Add a panel that highlights the currently executing line of code in sync with the visualization.
- **User Experience Improvements:** Themes, more advanced animations, and mobile compatibility improvements.
